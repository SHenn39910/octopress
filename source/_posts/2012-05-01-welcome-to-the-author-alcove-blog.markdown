Hello World! This is the first post on the Author Alcove blog, so I want to take a moment to introduce myself and to talk a bit about how Author Alcove will work. Welcome to the blog.<!-- more -->


## Who are you guys anyway?

I'm Jess Johnson, the solo founder and programmer behind Author Alcove, which means I'm the one behind the scenes keeping the lights on and working to keep everything ticking along smoothly. I'm also a book lover with a soft spot for steampunk, sci fi, fantasy, and treatises on programming. I have a secret crush on Patrick Rothfuss, and am currently reading "JavaScript: The Good Parts" by Douglas Crockford.      

I started Author Alcove because I don't think looking for new books to read should be time consuming or complicated, and there should be one place where I can keep track of new releases by all of my favorite authors.

## What do you do?

Author Alcove wants to help you answer one question: What should I read next? You tell us what authors you like, and we'll let you know when they publish new books. It's that simple. 

Curious? [Sign up for an invite here](http://authoralcove.com), and we will send you an invite when the beta launches. Early adopters are our favorite people.

## What's the deal with the blog?

This blog is another avenue for connecting with your favorite authors and the rest of the Author Alcove community. After the launch, we will be doing author features, book giveaways, and author interviews in this space. Plus we will post stats about the most anticipated new releases and the community's favorite authors. The blog is also the place to be for news about the launch and announcements of new and noteworthy Author Alcove features. [Sign up for blog updates here](http://feedburner.google.com/fb/a/mailverify?uri=TheAuthorAlcoveBlog&loc=en_US) and we will email you when new articles are posted. Or if you prefer [RSS updates](http://feeds.feedburner.com/TheAuthorAlcoveBlog), we have those too.

So now that you know a little bit about us, lets hear a little bit about you. What kind of books do you like? What can Author Alcove do for you?
